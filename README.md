### Aim:
  - Students should provide the best possible classification models using whatever method covered in class
  - Variable to Classify is Biodegradable
  - Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one [Remember: everything else being similar, the simplest models should be preferred]

### Processing notes:
  - Data is not normalized
  - Data has categorical and continuous variables
  - Data has missing values which should be handled accordingly
  - Data has 41 columns, and not all are important

### Objectives:
  - Produce the best Classification model
  - For the best model, test different hyperparameters
  - Identify the most significant features
